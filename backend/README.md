# Upgrade

These are the backend files. You need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

We have used [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as our package manager, but using `npm` is also fine.

## Installing

Run `yarn install` to fetch and install dependencies.

## Compiling

The project is built using `yarn compile`.

## Starting

You start the project with `yarn start`. Note that you have to recompile the files every time you have made changes.
