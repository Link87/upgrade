## Frontend

You can find the frontend files in the `frontend` folder. The frontend is based on Angular 8.

To deploy production builds you will need a separate web server like [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/).

### Setup

Run `yarn global add @angular/cli` to install angular. Then use `yarn install` to fetch all packages and you are good to go. Look at [this](frontend/README.md) file for further instructions.

## Backend

The backend files are located under `backend`. Further instructions can be found in [this](backend/README.md) file.
